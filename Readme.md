## *What is a Dot Product?*

The dot product is a mathematical operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (vectors) and returns a single number. It is defined mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i
$$

## *Code Implementation*

Below is a Python implementation of the vector dot-product algorithm:

python
def dot_product(vector_a, vector_b):
    if len(vector_a) != len(vector_b):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must be of the same length")
    return sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vector_a, vector_b))

# Example usage:
vector_a = [1, 2, 3]
vector_b = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(vector_a, vector_b)
print("Dot Product:", result)
